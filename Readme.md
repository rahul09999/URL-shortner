# Project Name: URL Shortener

Description:
The URL Shortener project is a web application that allows users to shorten long URLs into shorter, more manageable links. It provides a convenient way to share links on social media platforms, emails, or any other medium where long URLs are not desirable.

Key Features:

- URL Shortening: The application takes a long URL as input and generates a unique, shortened URL that redirects to the original long URL.

- Analytics: The system tracks the number of clicks and provides basic analytics on the usage of the shortened URLs.
- User Management: Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their shortened URLs.

Tech Stack:

- Backend: Node.js with Express.js framework
